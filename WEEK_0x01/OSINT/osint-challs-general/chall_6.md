on searching the image with google lems I found many links out of which was the one to the original tweet - `https://x.com/TajudenSoroush/status/1616108524026617856/photo/1` from 2023

and on searching a bit more I got this
`https://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:WaziriyaAutobombeIrak.jpg`


describing that the image belonged to USA and dates back to 2006-2007


Thus the event described by the journalist is completely fake.
