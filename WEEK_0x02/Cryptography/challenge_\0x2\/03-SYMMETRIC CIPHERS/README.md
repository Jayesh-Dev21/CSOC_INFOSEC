# Challenge - 2 {Crypto} [Sub Chall 2] Symmetric Cipher/Working of AES

**Keyed Permutations**

```txt
A "block" just refers to a fixed number of bits or bytes, which may represent any kind of data. AES processes a block and outputs another block. We'll be specifically talking the variant of AES which works on 128 bit (16 byte) blocks and a 128 bit key, known as AES-128.

**Resisting Bruteforce**

Biclique Attack redues the security margin of AES-128 only slightly, from 128 bits to 126.1 bits

`flag - crypto{Biclique}`
