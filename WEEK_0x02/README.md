# Week 2 {Cryptography}

Cryptography, as Wikipedia describes it, is the practice and study of techniques for secure communication in presence of adversarial behaviour.

In CTFs, crypto challenges include a wide variety of topics, but some topics are encountered more than the other:

Understanding and breaking cryptography  is a pretty nifty skill to have under oneâ€™s belt.

- RSA encryption scheme and related attacks
- Various ciphers like substitution cipher, vignere cipher, rail-fence cipher, ROT13, One Time Pad etc.
- AES encryption
- Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange algo.
- Hashing schemes like SHA256.
- Elliptic Curve Cryptography
- Lattices
- Post-Quantum Crypto

Note that the latter topics are more advanced.

A background in mathematics helps, if you find discrete mathematics interesting, you will enjoy Asymmetric encryption schemes ðŸ˜„

    Offers many cryptography challenges covering various topics also in a
    less gamified way. Most of their challenges focus more on crypto design
    and didactical aspects (like a tutorial in differential cryptanalysis)
    and it includes many challenges with historic or "obscure" procedures
    and machines (like HandyCipher or Sigaba).****
